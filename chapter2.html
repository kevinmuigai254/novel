<p class="a1">Chapter two</p>
<p class="a2">
Some students could call their parents home and lie to them that they had school projects which needed money.Mamba's deskmate once fooled his parents that he needed a thousand shillings to buy pythagoras theorem.Mamba tried this forgetting that his father was a teacher.Luckily it was during the april fools day so when he got caught he had to sanitize by claiming he was just joking on his parents.It was a nightmare for mamba to have his parents as teachers.When schools got closed and he went for holiday it would also mean that his parents were also on holiday.So when the other students would be enjoying their holiday ,mamba used to get free tuition from his parents.During one  of the holidays mamba went home with no assignment thinking he was lucky only for his parents to give him their own.Back in school problems always followed mamba.One weakness that mamba had was that he used to wet the bed.To make the matter worse he used to sleep in the upper bed.Since the school dorms were made up of double decker beds and students in lower grades would alwasy sleep on the upper bed while the senior students slept on the lower beds.One day mamba wet the bed,to his bad luck the urine went down to the bed bellow him.What mamba did not know is that the captain of the rugby school team had just moved to be sleeping below him.He was feared since he had a big body with six parks and muscles.He was just enjoying his sleep in the middle of the night .He thought he was dreaming of rain only to wake up smelling like urine.He was so mad with mamba that he revenged him by making him wash a whole tree with a handkerchief ,a bar of soap and a bucket of water untill it was sparkling clean.Unfortunately the following day he also wet the bed.This time round he was told to cut grass using a nail cutter.He had to cut grass in the whole rugby pitch using a nail cutter.He got tired of all this and he decided to look for a new bedmate,this time round he made sure that his new bedmate was also bedwetting.The main advantage of having a bedwetting bedmate is that every time mamba would wet his bed ,his bedmate would wake up thinking that he was the one and not mamba.Another challenge mamba faced was theft.He once went to shower,he just blinked his eyes for a second to clean his face only to open his eyes and find out that his towel had been stolen while he was in his birthday suit.He had to wait for everyone to go to sleep.He waited till the lights were switched off so that he would come out of the bathroom.Just as he was tip toeing to his bed he slipped and fell.It was so bad that everyone woke up.The lights were turned on only for everyone to find mamba on the floor naked.Well this was not the only incidence.Since mamba used to wet the bed he had to wash his clothes regularly.On one good sunny day he decided to wash all his clothes at once since after weeks of heavy rains in the school the weather had become conducive.He went to the toilet and after coming back to check on his clothes he thought his eyes were playing a trick on him.The thief had stolen all his clothes and left only pegs and his boxer which had a hole at the center.He had been welcomed officially to highschool life.Even if he repoted to the teachers the school had over a thousand students hence there was no way of catching the thief.As the saying goes when you go to rome do as romans do ,mamba took this saying seriously and he eventually became a thief.One day he waited till everyone was asleep at night.He tip toed to the hanging line where he found clothes which the owner had left them there thinking he would find them in the morning.He stole them and went to sleep ,he was as happy as a king.The following morning he woke up and tried wearing those clothes only to find out they were oversize.Since he was so slim it looked like he was wearing a sack.He thought maybe it was his bad day ,hence the following night he went back to stealing.The results were the same he woke up the following day with a pair of shoes which were both of the left leg.He had learned his lesson the hard way never steal at night.
