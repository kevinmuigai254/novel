When the wise men  said that a hungry man is an angry man they were definetily not bluffing.The most important time in the school programme was during meals.The school had a system where students were organised into tables of ten members in which meals were served.When the list of table members came out mamba could not believe that he was placed in the same table with six rugby members and two known school bullies.He was likely the weakest in the group and the number one rule was evey man for himself God for us all.Eating depended on how good you were as they always scrammed for food.The first month that mamba joined the school he was just hearing rumours that there was meat in school  as his plate never had even a piece of meat.It got worse during special meals like eggs sausages as mamba could just get news that people have eaten sausages while their share of sausages did not even reach to them.The most painful thing is getting out of a scrum with an injury and end up with no food.Mamba met some of the worst bullies as one of them once ate his food and after he was full he came back and asked mamba for a tissue.It was the worst disrespect to mankind.With time he grew a thick skin and started fighting for food.One day he was assigned the task of going to take the food from the kitchen.He used this chance to revenge,by the time he was getting to the table half of the meat was missing.He had already learned the trick of eating on the way .One day this trick went wrong when he put a potato in the mouth not knowing it was as hot as hell.It was the toughest dilemma as he wondered whether he was to swallow or spit.There was a school canteen inside the school where students could buy cakes and mandazi.The school schedule for meals was that the students took their breakfast at six in the morning,then later at ten they would have a tea break ,at noon they would go and have their lunch and later supper at seven in the evening.It was during tea break that students bought food stuff from the canteen.Those with money could buy chapati and skip lunch since they had something to eat.The worst nightmare is missing food from the table and you do not have pocket money to buy food from the canteen.Those  students were undergoing forced fasting.One student 'fasted' for more days than Jesus as he went for forty one days.He got so weak that he was hospitalized.Mamba was among those who did not have pocket money.He used to avoid being in class during tea breaks since it was a nightmare to watch people eat while the aroma of the cakes is killing you and you have nothing to eat.Instead he would go to the field and sleep.The number of those who had nothing to eat during break time became huge and they became creative.Since they had nothing to do during breaktime they could  join  in the field the members of the christian union who gatherd to praise,worship and pray as a way of passing time to end the break time.Others entered into debts to afford pocket money which they paid by labour like washing clothes and others doing assignments for others in exchange of money.Well not only cakes and mandazi were sold in school ,some naughty students managed to sneak drugs which they sold for a living.They sold propaganda to other students that if you smoked bhang before sitting for an exam it would open your mind and make you clever leading to passing in the exam.Mamba saw this as an opportunity to pass as he had been failing all along since he joined school.He bought the bhang ,smoked it and went for a chemistry exam.Before he could even start answering the questions he started seeing hallucinations.He forgot himself and instead of seeing an exam paper he started seeing a newspaper infront of him.He saw himself as a journalist .He started reading the questions to the others thinking he was reading the news.All this happening in the middle of the exam session.The other students in the room could not hold their laughter.The examiner moved closer to him to confront him as he was causing chaos in the middle of an exam.He thought the examiner was the cameraman as he was holding a phone.
